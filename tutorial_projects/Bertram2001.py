# Main prupose of this scrip to gain detailed insight in the paper of Bertram et al. 2001:
# multiple walking speed-frequency relations are predicted by constrained optimization

# exp relation: F = Cv^b with b = 0.58

# ToDo: maybe make example of constrained optimization theory presented in this paper. I think that the main limitation
# of this paper is that they did not try to collect data/ create cost landscapes of candidate objective functions
# (e.g. metabolic cost)
