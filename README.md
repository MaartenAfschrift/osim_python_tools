# osim_tools_python

contains several python tools for workflows in opensim. I typically include this repo as an submodule in my projects. Creating a python package would probably be even beteer, but I dont know how to do this and the code is at that stage...

I stole some things from pyosim (InverseKinematics and InverseDynamics) and utilsTRC from OpenCap.

Main the class osim_subject you can find in osim_utilities.py in python is something useful and (currently) novel in this repository. You can use this class for batch processing (see examples)
